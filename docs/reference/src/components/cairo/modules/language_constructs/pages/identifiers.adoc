= Identifiers

An identifier is a sequence of one or more alphanumeric characters and underscores that is used to
name a language construct.
The exceptions are:

- A single underscore character does not form an identifier.
- Cairo xref:keywords.adoc[keywords] can't be used as identifiers.

[NOTE]
====
Identifiers starting with an underscore are typically used to indicate an identifier that is intentionally unused, and will silence the unused warning.

== Case sensitivity

Cairo is a _case-sensitive_ language.
This means that identifiers that differ by case of one or more of their characters are distinct.
